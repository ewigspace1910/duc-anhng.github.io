Thanks to assisstance from [Ass.Prof Nguyen Ngoc Hoa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sUQ6eEsAAAAJ&hl=vi), I have done the first paper, namely [Impact Analysis of Different Effective Loss Functions by Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Face Recognition](https://ewigspace1910.github.io/publication/2022-11-01-firstpaper) that is accepted to public in The 24th International Conference on Asia-Pacific Digital Libraries (ICADL 2022).
