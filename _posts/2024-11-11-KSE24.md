The 16th IEEE International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE 2024)  will be held from 5 - 7 November 2024. The main objectives of the conference is to bring together researchers, practitioners, and students not only for the presentation, discussion, and exchange of state-of-the-art research and practical applications but also to foster collaboration in the fields. KSE 2024 this year will be held in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia, which is renowned for its multiculturalism with many cultural sites and activities.

Once again, KSE 2024 is held overseas  so I have to attend the online session. Hopefully one day I can afford to buy a plane ticket abroad and attend an offline conference outside of Vietnam üòÅ
